If you want to improve from there, here are a few notes to boost quality:</span><ol><li>I like to truss the bird before cooking. It helps the chicken cook evenly. There are many ways to truss a bird, but here is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpSPfuJQVOA">first one I learned</a>&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s dead simple.</li><li>90% of the time I&rsquo;m seasoning with salt I reach for kosher salt. Its larger crystal size makes it easy to handle and see. Because it is easier to see than table salt, kosher helps you learn how much salt gives your food a specific saltiness. (Also, keep in mind the fattier or starchier the product, the more salt that is needed).</li><li>To boost flavor of the breast meat, you can slip a few pats of butter underneath the skin before cooking.</li><li>One technique for getting ultra-crispy skin is to season your bird and leave it uncovered in the refrigerator overnight.</li><li>Whether you use the above technique or not, it is good to let your chicken temper before cooking.&nbsp; I usually like to let the bird sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours before cooking.&nbsp; This is not a must, but it will help you minimize overcooked areas of chicken.&#8203;</li></ol></div>  <div><div class="wsite-multicol"><div class="wsite-multicol-table-wrap" style="margin:0 -15px;"> 	<table class="wsite-multicol-table"> 		<tbody class="wsite-multicol-tbody"> 			<tr class="wsite-multicol-tr"> 				<td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="width:50%; padding:0 15px;"> 					 						  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ryan-apron.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%">Ryan cooks</div> </div></div>   					 				</td>				<td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="width:50%; padding:0 15px;"> 					 						  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><br /><br /><span>Well, there you have it, my first blog post. Hopefully you found at least something in there helpful. I plan to share a few more weeknight &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; in the future. But one thing I&rsquo;d like to do, and have not seen in other cooking blogs, is to approach recipes you readers are ALREADY cooking. I&rsquo;d like to write about small changes or areas of focus that could improve the quality of the dish. Please send in recipes you&rsquo;d like to see get (for lack of a better term) &ldquo;work-shopped&rdquo; to Dave and Shannon.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>I want to say &ldquo;Happy cooking&rdquo;</span><br /><span>-Ryan</span><br /><br /></div>   					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </div></div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span>&#8203;But in a cool way that doesn&rsquo;t sound clich&eacute; or hammy.&nbsp; Maybe I&rsquo;ll think of something for next time.
