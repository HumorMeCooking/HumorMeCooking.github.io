		Today I wanted to share a weeknight staple of mine that is satisfying enough to serve at a dinner party. This is a dish that home cooks and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxm1vPwUQDY">high-end chefs</a>&nbsp;love.
	</p>
	<p>Roast Chicken!</p>
	<p>
		I like to roast a whole chicken in a hot oven over root vegetables. A one pot meal that is easy as it is delicious (this is NOT hyperbole).
	</p>
	<p>
		<u>Ingredients:</u><br />
		<ul>
			<li>1 Whole Fryer Chicken (3 &ndash; 4 lbs.)</li>
			<li>Assorted Root vegetables (Example: 1 onion, 3-4 small turnips)</li>
			<li>Salt (preferably Kosher)</li>
			<li>Pepper (freshly ground)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
	<p>
		<u>Instructions:</u>
		<ul>
			<li>Heat oven to 450F with &nbsp;rack in the middle position</li>
			<li>Cut up vegetables to the size of golf balls</li>
			<li>Place veggies in an oven safe pan (I like a 12in cast iron skillet)</li>
			<li>Pat chicken dry (inside and out) with paper towels (The drier the skin the crispier it will get)</li>
			<li>Aggressively salt and pepper the bird (inside and out)</li>
			<li>Place whole bird directly on top of the veggies</li>
			<li>Place all into oven and cook for an hour</li>
			<li>Remove from oven and let chicken rest for 10-15 min</li>
			<li>Carve and serve with the vegetables</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you aren&rsquo;t much of a cook yet, just follow the above instructions. If you want to improve from there, here are a few notes to boost quality:
	</p>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				I like to truss the bird before cooking. It helps the chicken cook evenly. There are many ways to truss a bird, but here is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpSPfuJQVOA">first one I learned</a>&nbsp;and it&rsquo;s dead simple.
			</li>
			<li>
				90% of the time I&rsquo;m seasoning with salt I reach for kosher salt. Its larger crystal size makes it easy to handle and see. Because it is easier to see than table salt, kosher helps you learn how much salt gives your food a specific saltiness. (Also, keep in mind the fattier or starchier the product, the more salt that is needed).
			</li>
			<li>
				To boost flavor of the breast meat, you can slip a few pats of butter underneath the skin before cooking.
			</li>
			<li>
				One technique for getting ultra-crispy skin is to season your bird and leave it uncovered in the refrigerator overnight.
			</li>
			<li>
				Whether you use the above technique or not, it is good to let your chicken temper before cooking.&nbsp; I usually like to let the bird sit at room temperature for 1-2 hours before cooking.&nbsp; This is not a must, but it will help you minimize overcooked areas of chicken.&#8203;
			</li>
		</ol>

		Well, there you have it, my first blog post. Hopefully you found at least something in there helpful. I plan to share a few more weeknight &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; in the future. But one thing I&rsquo;d like to do, and have not seen in other cooking blogs, is to approach recipes you readers are ALREADY cooking. I&rsquo;d like to write about small changes or areas of focus that could improve the quality of the dish. Please send in recipes you&rsquo;d like to see get (for lack of a better term) &ldquo;work-shopped&rdquo; to <a href="mailto:Humormecooking@gmail.com">Humormecooking@gmail.com</a>

		I want to say &ldquo;Happy cooking&rdquo;<br />

	</p> 
	<p>
		But in a cool way that doesn&rsquo;t sound clich&eacute; or hammy.&nbsp; Maybe I&rsquo;ll think of something for next time. Until then, cook like your next meal depends on it&hellip;
		<span>Sorry,</span><br />
