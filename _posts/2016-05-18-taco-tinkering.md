				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Tacos! <em>&#9834; What is it good for?&nbsp; Absolutely everything! </em><em>&#9834;</em>&nbsp;<br />&#8203;<br />You can practically wrap anything around a tortilla and call it a taco. That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you should, but you certainly can.&nbsp; Tacos are as versatile as they are delicious. Today, though, I want to focus on the standard American weeknight staple, the ground beef taco. Boring? Sure, but it is easy, delicious, and something that most people already cook for dinner.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />This article is going to hopefully exemplify the type of cooking posts that I will write in the future.&nbsp; My goal is to help people become better cooks. I plan to do this not by providing quality recipes (although I hope to do that too), but by discussing the recipes people are already using. I&rsquo;ll elaborate.</div>  <div><div class="wsite-multicol"><div class="wsite-multicol-table-wrap" style="margin:0 -15px;"> 	<table class="wsite-multicol-table"> 		<tbody class="wsite-multicol-tbody"> 			<tr class="wsite-multicol-tr"> 				<td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="width:56.462585034014%; padding:0 15px;"> 					 						  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/two-tacos.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>   					 				</td>				<td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="width:43.537414965986%; padding:0 15px;"> 					 						  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">&#8203;Cooking became a serious hobby of mine in my early twenties. My biggest mistake during that time was assuming that being a good cook was simply a matter of finding good recipes and following them with precision. It is important, especially early on, to find good recipes, but it&rsquo;s a smaller factor of good cooking than you might think. My cooking skills did not begin to excel until I learned the importance of technique. Do you ever look at a recipe that tells you to cook in a&nbsp;</div>   					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </div></div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span>pan on medium-high heat and wonder, why not high? Why not medium? Does it matter?&nbsp; It might, but it might not. It all depends on what you are cooking and what you are trying to achieve. &nbsp;</span><br /><br />&#8203;Cooking techniques on the surface are fairly basic, but there are plenty of nuances that you learn as you apply them to different foods and different cuisines. By familiarizing yourself with how food reacts with specific cooking techniques, you will free yourself from the rigidity of the recipe. It will also help you execute recipes with greater success. Hopefully I will provide you with an easy way to acquire cooking knowledge and technique that will be immediately helpful. And because we&rsquo;ll do this with recipes you already cook, it will be easy to practice.<br />&#8203;<br />So let&rsquo;s get to the tacos.<br /><br /></div>  <div><div class="wsite-multicol"><div class="wsite-multicol-table-wrap" style="margin:0 -15px;"> 	<table class="wsite-multicol-table"> 		<tbody class="wsite-multicol-tbody"> 			<tr class="wsite-multicol-tr"> 				<td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="width:50%; padding:0 15px;"> 					 						  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Baseline:</strong>&nbsp; The Taco Kit<br /><br />&ldquo;Just Add Meat&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><br />Tacos are a weeknight staple across this country because they are quick and easy.

We&rsquo;ll look at how we can improve each component starting with the easiest to the more laborious modifications. Try as many or as few suggestions as you&rsquo;d like.

I&rsquo;m&nbsp;&#8203;sure there are plenty of details that I will have left out for brevity, so please ask for any needed clarifications in the comment section. I will try to promptly reply.</span></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">&nbsp;<br /><font size="5">Meat</font><br />I like to use a lean ground beef (90% or higher) or venison for basic tacos.&nbsp; Ground Turkey or Chicken isn&rsquo;t too bad either if you are looking to cut calories.&nbsp; Fatty beef makes for an oily taco filling with muddled flavors.&nbsp;<br />&#8203;<ol><li><strong>Add onion.</strong> Saut&eacute; a small chopped onion in a little oil over medium heat until soft before adding your meat and spices. [You find this addition in most ground beef taco recipes.&nbsp; Onions are a work horse in the kitchen.&nbsp; They add a depth and boost meaty flavor.</li><li><strong>Bloom spices</strong>. Before you add meat or onion, add your spices or spice packet to the hot oil.&nbsp; Let the spice cook until fragrant and then add your next ingredient. [Blooming helps extract the spices&rsquo; flavor and aromatics.&nbsp; This is a good technique to use with most food preparations ]</li><li><strong>Ditch the packet</strong>. Make your own taco seasoning. 2 T Chili Powder, 1 t Cumin, &frac12; t Oregano, and Salt (to taste). This is a good base.&nbsp; Coriander, cayenne pepper, and/or other chili varieties are great additions. Add a few cloves of minced garlic as well. (T = tablespoon, t = teaspoon)</li><li><strong>Add flavorful liquid. </strong>Many spice packets instruct you to add a cup or so of water and reduce with a simmer as you cook the meat.&nbsp; This is fine, but a homemade chicken stock boosts flavor and umami. Also, throw in a half cup of salsa or tomato sauce.</li><li><strong>Season to taste (not just with salt).</strong> One of the most important skill to develop as a cook is adjusting the seasoning at the end of cooking. Salt is your number one friend here.&nbsp; It adds saltiness, but it also enhances most other flavors. If your dish tastes flat, it&rsquo;s because it needs salt. Most recipes do not call for enough salt. Brown sugar is another good tool to bring out the sweetness in the tomato sauce. Try a teaspoon at a time and see how you like the addition. Acid is a tool that experience cooks use much more often than novices. Seasoning with acid can brighten otherwise one note stews and savory preparations. A little can go a long way so be careful. For tacos I like to use apple cider vinegar or lime juice. White vinegar works fine as well.</li></ol></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/taco-toppings.jpg?515" alt="Picture" style="width:515;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><font size="5">Toppings</font><br />There are endless ideas for toppings. Here I&rsquo;m just going to talk about maximizing the flavor of the basics.<ol><li><strong>Cheese.</strong> Whatever cheese you like on your taco, the simplest way to maximize flavor is to grate your own cheese. Pre-shredded cheese is dulled down by anti-caking agents (wood pulp). Flavor is further diminished by the huge increase in surface area of pre-shredded cheese.&nbsp; It much quicker to pick up off flavors and dry out.</li><li><strong>Onion.</strong> Rinse your chopped onion. When you cut onions, sulfur compounds are released that are responsible for the harsh taste of raw onion. Try rinsing them in a strainer with cold water for a few seconds and watch raw onion haters convert.</li><li><strong>Season you toppings.</strong> Chopped tomato, avocado, and even lettuce can benefit from a little salt. As a general rule, it&rsquo;s good to make sure all components of a dish are well seasoned. Just make sure you season just before serving. Lettuce and tomato can go south if they sit salted for a length of time. For seasoning lettuce I like to use the fine grained popcorn salt (works great for seasoning salads).</li><li><strong>Lime.</strong> A squeeze of fresh lime adds that last bit of brightness and fresh flavor that will take your taco to the next level.</li></ol></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><br /><font size="5">The Shell </font><br />Crunchy or soft, the tortilla is probably the most overlooked component to a great taco.<ol><li><strong>Fry</strong> your own crispy taco shells. Buy soft corn tortillas and fry them in oil. I believe this is the single biggest thing you can do to improve your homemade tacos. I cannot emphasize enough how much better home-fried shells are than their salted cardboard counterparts. Please try this at least once. It&rsquo;s a complete game changer.&nbsp;<br /><ul><li>Heat a heavy bottom skillet or sauce pan with 1 &frac12; in &ndash; 2 in of oil over medium heat. Using tongs and a long handled spoon/spatula to handle the tortillas, dip half of the tortilla in the oil while trying to keep the other half folded over in a taco shell shape. <em>(This is not easy. Your shells will probably look pretty ugly the first few times you do this.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s okay, because they will still taste amazing.)</em> Fry the shell till it crisps to a light golden color. Next fry the other half shell while trying to maintain the taco shape. Place fried tortilla on paper towels.&nbsp; Repeat.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Soft shell.</strong> I have no experience making my own tortilla shells. It&rsquo;s on my to-do list. <a href="http://www.rickbayless.com/recipe/flour-tortillas/">Rick Bayless</a> is as good of a resource as any if you want to give it a shot. The next best thing to homemade tortillas is to purchase them from a local Mexican restaurant. As far as the store bought variety, <a href="http://www.cooksillustrated.com/">Cooks Illustrated</a> recommends Old El Paso flour tortillas and Maria and Ricardo&rsquo;s corn tortillas.</li></ol>&nbsp;<br />I hope some of this information is helpful. The format and style of future posts will most likely evolve to become streamlined and digestible, no pun intended. Most importantly, please, PLEASE, let me know what you liked and didn&rsquo;t like about this post. I need your feedback to make these posts better.<br /><br />Enjoy your tacos.<br />&#8203;<br />See you next time,<br />-Ryan<br /><br /></div>
