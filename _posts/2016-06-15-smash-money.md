		When I was a youngster, McDonald&rsquo;s served my ideal burger. The thin little patty was not the star, rather just a member of the condiment and bun ensemble. Although my preference was a result of McDonald&rsquo;s ubiquitous marketing, I had also never tasted a properly cooked burger. Every substantially sized burger I encountered was dry and bland. No matter how many condiments I used to make the beef pucks palatable, the desiccated mass of overcooked protein stood front and center, ruining everything. It wasn&rsquo;t until my twenties, when I first experienced a great burger. While I savored the crispy crusted, juicy, flavor bomb of beef (that&rsquo;s what he said), I soon became angry. How had I gone two decades without experiencing true love?&nbsp;

		While I have learned some of the finer points of cooking a proper Thick Burger&trade;, today I want to bridge the gap between fat &ldquo;gourmet&rdquo; burgers and the skinny delights of my youth (that&rsquo;s what he said?). Sorry. I&rsquo;ll stop. Where was I? Ah, the Smash Burger&trade;. <a href="https://www.shakeshack.com/">Shake Shack</a> has taken the US by storm.&nbsp; What started as a New York City food cart is now a publicly traded company expanding across the country. My hometown of St. Louis will host a location come 2017. While Steak'n Shake has been employing the smash technique since the 30&rsquo;s and a more recent chain has incorporated it as their&nbsp;<a href="http://smashburger.com/">name</a>, Shake Shack is often credited with perfecting the method.
	<p>
		Shack burgers use the smash to maximize crust formation, but leave enough thickness that allows for a medium to medium-well center. When I realized one of my gurus, <a href="http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2009/10/the-burger-lab-the-fake-shack-how-to-make-shake-shack-burger.html">J. Kenji Lopez-Alt</a>, had already tackled recreating the Shake Shack burger, I had to give it a go. I didn&rsquo;t follow his instructions to a tee, in fact; really all I did is smash ground beef in a hot skillet, but I was impressed with the results. Salty, crusty burgers were enjoyed by my family. Even my 15 month-old was impressed. While literally chewing on the idea of the smash technique, I got to thinking how I could make the burgers even better.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since entering prime grill season, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the flavor boost of combusted fats over hot coals. What if I could add smoky grilled goodness to the maillard munch of a smash burger? Pressing a burger through my Weber grate would just end as a sacrifice to the Grill Gods. As much as I&rsquo;d like to win their favor, especially from Chip Hardwood, the God of Smoke, my family&rsquo;s bellies take precedence. While pondering this issue, my peripheral vision picked up on a hanging cast iron pan. That&rsquo;s it! The solution is a pan that can handle serious abuse. My plan was to start a blazing hot fire covering enough space to heat the pan while also allowing for an area to finish over hot coals
	</p>
	<p>
		I had good luck with this technique. While it didn&rsquo;t impart as much grill flavor as I had hoped, I was able to make delicious smashed burgers without destroying my kitchen. Below is an adaptation of Kenji&rsquo;s <a href="http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2009/10/the-burger-lab-the-fake-shack-how-to-make-shake-shack-burger.html">recipe</a>, for the grill. I recommend using ground chuck because it contains enough fat to keep these medium / medium-well burgers from drying out. I wouldn&rsquo;t go much lower than 15% fat for these burgers.

		<strong>Instructions:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Light enough charcoal to cover your grill with area to heat your pan and leaving room to cook directly over coals.
			</li>
			<li>
				Form ground beef into 8 pucks (see picture) ~ 3oz each.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place pan on grill over hot coals. Allow to heat for at least 10 min.
			</li>
			<li>
				Butter both sides of buns. Brown buttered size on the grill while pan heats up.
			</li>
			<li>
				Using tongs and a paper towel dipped in oil, brush the grates and pan with a light coat.
			</li>
			<li>
				Season one side of beef puck with salt and pepper. Place seasoned side down on pan and smash with a spatula using tongs to help generate force until patty is ~1/4 inch thick. Take care pulling your spatula off of the burger. A little jiggling may be necessary to get it off. (I told myself I&rsquo;d stop)
			</li>
			<li>
				Season top of smashed burger with salt and pepper. After a minute or two, when you see the edges getting crispy brown, scrape the burger with spatula and flip directly on to the grill above hot coals.
			</li>
			<li>
				Place a slice of cheese on the patty. After a minute or so, transfer patty to a plate or wire rack.
			</li>
			<li>
				Repeat process with another 3oz of beef without adding cheese. Stack the cooked patty on top of the other and serve on grilled buns w/ condiments of choice.
			</li>
			<li>
				Repeat process for the remaining burgers.
			</li>
		</ul>
