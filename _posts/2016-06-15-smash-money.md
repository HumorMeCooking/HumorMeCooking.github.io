				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;">When I was a youngster, McDonald&rsquo;s served my ideal burger. The thin little patty was not the star, rather just a member of the condiment and bun ensemble. Although my preference was a result of McDonald&rsquo;s ubiquitous marketing, I had also never tasted a properly cooked burger. Every substantially sized burger I encountered was dry and bland. No matter how many condiments I used to make the beef pucks palatable, the desiccated mass of overcooked protein stood front and center, ruining everything. It wasn&rsquo;t until my twenties, when I first experienced a great burger. While I savored the crispy crusted, juicy, flavor bomb of beef (that&rsquo;s what he said), I soon became angry. How had I gone two decades without experiencing true love?&nbsp;</div>  <div><div class="wsite-multicol"><div class="wsite-multicol-table-wrap" style="margin:0 -15px;"> 	<table class="wsite-multicol-table"> 		<tbody class="wsite-multicol-tbody"> 			<tr class="wsite-multicol-tr"> 				<td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="width:56.462585034014%; padding:0 15px;"> 					 						  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/smash-burger.jpg" alt="Picture of a smash burger" style="width:auto;max-width:100%" /> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>   					 				</td>				<td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="width:43.537414965986%; padding:0 15px;"> 					 						  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><br />&#8203;While I have learned some of the finer points of cooking a proper Thick Burger&trade;, today I want to bridge the gap between fat &ldquo;gourmet&rdquo; burgers and the skinny delights of my youth (that&rsquo;s what he said?). Sorry. I&rsquo;ll stop. Where was I? Ah, the Smash Burger&trade;. <a href="https://www.shakeshack.com/">Shake Shack</a> has taken the US by storm.&nbsp; What started as a New York City food cart is now a publicly traded company expanding across the country. My hometown of St. Louis will host a location come 2017. While Steak &nbsp;</div>   					 				</td>			</tr> 		</tbody> 	</table> </div></div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;"><span>'n Shake has been employing the smash technique since the 30&rsquo;s and a more recent chain has incorporated it as their&nbsp;</span><a href="http://smashburger.com/">name</a><span>, Shake Shack is often credited with perfecting the method.&nbsp;</span>&#8203;<br />&#8203;</div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;">Shack burgers use the smash to maximize crust formation, but leave enough thickness that allows for a medium to medium-well center. When I realized one of my gurus, <a href="http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2009/10/the-burger-lab-the-fake-shack-how-to-make-shake-shack-burger.html">J. Kenji Lopez-Alt</a>, had already tackled recreating the Shake Shack burger, I had to give it a go. I didn&rsquo;t follow his instructions to a tee, in fact; really all I did is smash ground beef in a hot skillet, but I was impressed with the results. Salty, crusty burgers were enjoyed by my family. Even my 15 month-old was impressed. While literally chewing on the idea of the smash technique, I got to thinking how I could make the burgers even better.&nbsp;<br />&#8203;</div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;">&#8203;Since entering prime grill season, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the flavor boost of combusted fats over hot coals. What if I could add smoky grilled goodness to the maillard munch of a smash burger? Pressing a burger through my Weber grate would just end as a sacrifice to the Grill Gods. As much as I&rsquo;d like to win their favor, especially from Chip Hardwood, the God of Smoke, my family&rsquo;s bellies take precedence. While pondering this issue, my peripheral vision picked up on a hanging cast iron pan. That&rsquo;s it! The solution is a pan that can handle serious abuse. My plan was to start a blazing hot fire covering enough space to heat the pan while also allowing for an area to finish over hot coals.&nbsp;<br />&#8203;</div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;">I had good luck with this technique. While it didn&rsquo;t impart as much grill flavor as I had hoped, I was able to make delicious smashed burgers without destroying my kitchen. Below is an adaptation of Kenji&rsquo;s <a href="http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2009/10/the-burger-lab-the-fake-shack-how-to-make-shake-shack-burger.html">recipe</a>, for the grill. I recommend using ground chuck because it contains enough fat to keep these medium / medium-well burgers from drying out. I wouldn&rsquo;t go much lower than 15% fat for these burgers.</div>  <div><div class="wsite-multicol"><div class="wsite-multicol-table-wrap" style="margin:0 -15px;"> 	<table class="wsite-multicol-table"> 		<tbody class="wsite-multicol-tbody"> 			<tr class="wsite-multicol-tr"> 				<td class="wsite-multicol-col" style="width:50%; padding:0 15px;"> 					 						  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">&#8203;<br /><strong>&#8203;Ingredients:</strong><br />&nbsp;(Yield: 4 Double stack burgers)<ul><li>1 &frac12; lbs.
